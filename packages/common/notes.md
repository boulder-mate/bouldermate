Common defines types for all the data, however this of course will not always strictly be applied.

For example, a 'User' in the frontend or backend may have actual location data instead of IDs, or not have them at all
However, we do not always make fields optional as this folder is essentially used as a database schema for the moment - it definitely should not be that way forever
